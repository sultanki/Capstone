# Capstone


Hello

Welcome to my Capstone project repository!!

The project is based one the Wide World Importers Microsoft demo data warehouse and database. 
As an analyst, I was tasked with defining business problems for the wholesaler by exploring past sales, seasonal trends, inventory rates, demand and replenishment rates. 

Various scripts were created in R and SQL to retreive data tables from the SQL Server data warehouse. Various data modeling steps were done with Power BI, again bringing in data as needed from SSMS then shaping and visualizing to gain insight into the customers, products, and sales.

Additional variables like ROI and replenishment rates were calculated. Then I applied machine learning prediction models to see if ROI predicted accurately on test data for top products. Linear models and random forest were compared. 

The Capstone final project lead to an analysis plan for WWI. 

Additional information for the company can be found online:
